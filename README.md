# potato-disease

Potato farmers confront significant annual economic losses due to diseases like early blight and late blight. Detecting these diseases promptly and taking appropriate action can lead to substantial savings.

The main goal of this project is to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of identifying early blight and late blight diseases in images. This model serves as a valuable tool for farmers, aiding them in reducing losses through early disease detection and intervention.

Additionally, the project extends its utility by offering a RESTful API solution. This API provides predictions on whether a potato has early blight or late blight disease. These RESTful APIs are hosted on the Google Cloud Platform via Cloud Functions, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for farmers and stakeholders.
